### Using Git Tools to Manage File Changes and Collaborate: Version Control
* 21 November, 1300-1630hrs Atlantic / 1330-1700hrs NL
* Version control is the practice of managing and sharing changes to documents, programming code, websites or any other files to keep track of what’s been changed, by whom, when and why. All previous versions of files are saved and you can even revert to a previous version. Git-portal sites, like GitHub or GitLab, offer many useful features to facilitate collaborative development. This is a two-part series. In this beginner level first session, we will show you how to create a repository, record changes to files, explore and restore from the recorded history and how to resolve conflicts (when one member overwrites another’s changes).

### Using Git Tools to Manage File Changes and Collaborate: Collaboration
* 28 November, 1300-1630hrs Atlantic / 1330-1700hrs NL
* This is the second session of our two-part series. This workshop will focus on collaborative development workflows using Git-collaboration sites like GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket, and will demonstrate how to work with branches, issue tracking, contribute to projects using pull-/merge-requests, code-review, how to run CI/CD-pipelines and use other common features of these platforms. Prerequisite: basic experience using Git version control, participation in the 21 November workshop, or attendance at the Git lecture of a software carpentry workshop.

### Visualization with R
* 29 November, 1300-1500hrs Atlantic / 1330-1530hrs NL
* When working with large sets of numbers, it is often more useful to display the information graphically using histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, box plots and other depictions. This workshop teaches participants how to gain insights into data through visualization using R as the programming language. Participants will learn how to: create simple scatterplots, histograms, and box plots; compare the plotting features of base R and the ggplot2 package; plot with ggplot2; plot time series data; and arrange and export plots. Basic knowledge of R is recommended, although not mandatory.
