### Summary

Hello! Thanks for joining us! Here's an overview for new elders/organizers.

* Slack
    - `#elders` is the main channel, and probably the only locked channel.
    - Optional: some put a mortar-board icon next to our name, as a signal that people can ask us questions. 
* Meetup
    - [here](https://www.meetup.com/pei-developers/)
    - We use it but aren't sure how many people pay attention (vs Slack).
* web-site
    - [here](https://peidevs.github.io/)
    - A former elder was kind enough to design the website.
    - Hosted courtesy of Forestry.io (confirm?) 
    - We rarely update it.
* Google Drive
    - Used for a few private docs, most of which are old and dusty.
    - e.g. Prep for planning meetings, and then notes/action items. 
* GitHub
    - [here](https://github.com/orgs/peidevs/repositories)
    - We have an organization, "peidevs".
    - The main public facing repos are:
        - [Event_Resources](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources) for event stuff
            - we have a CSV log of all meetups [here](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/MeetUps_v2.csv)
        - [Resources](https://github.com/peidevs/Resources) for public doc
    - Long ago, we encouraged code projects for collaboration but it never took off.
* misc:
    - peidevs@gmail.com is public-facing contact
        - Slack reminder to check every Wednesday
    - active Twitter account
    - no Facebook page (there was an anemic one, but we killed it)
* authentication creds:
    - It's complicated :-)
    - Ask us as needed and we'll be happy to help.
* organization
    - Many years ago, a cat-herder would take a 3-month sprint. The cat-herder would find speakers, delegate tasks to volunteers, emcee the event, and be "team captain".
    - We still follow the cat-herder model, but now someone will volunteer "just-in-time" for any given month.
        - we have a handy checklist [here](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/Checklist.md)
        - some have tried to automate the above with GitHub issues, but it never took off
        - we have a list of pending talks [here](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/PendingMeetUps.md)
    - Typically, we don't meet in December or July, but sometimes have social events in those months.
