### Summary

An overview for new elders/organizers.

* Slack
    - `#elders` is the main channel, and probably the only locked channel.
    - Optional: some put a mortar-board icon next to our name, as a signal that people can ask us questions. 
* Meetup
    - [here](https://www.meetup.com/pei-developers/)
    - We use it but aren't sure how many people pay attention (vs Slack).
* web-site
    - [here](https://peidevs.github.io/)
    - A former elder was kind enough to design the website.
    - We rarely update it, and it's a bit of slog to rediscover the process.
* Google Drive
    - We use this for a few private docs, most of which are old and dusty.
    - e.g. Prep for planning meetings, and then notes/action items. 
* misc:
    - peidevs@gmail.com is used, mostly for Startup Zone
        - Slack reminder to check every Wednesday
    - active Twitter account
    - no Facebook page (there was an anemic one, but we killed it)
* authentication creds:
    - It's complicated :-)
    - Ask us as needed and we'll be happy to help.
* organization
    - Many years ago, a cat-herder would take a 3-month sprint. The cat-herder would find speakers, delegate tasks to volunteers, emcee the event, and be "team captain".
    - We still follow the cat-herder/captain model, but now someone will volunteer "just-in-time" for any given month.
