### Intro

This is an informal doc in response to outreach by [Code for Canada](http://www.codeforcanada.org/). They asked about our group and our keys to community building.

### History

* [PEI Developers](http://peidevs.github.io/about/) is group of software developers (and web designers, techies) that meet every month (and have special events). Monthly meetings usually feature 2 speakers on tech topics.   
* Founded in April 2012 by Dustin Sparks. In 2015, we formed a planning committee that has approximately 8 members. 
* A spin-off group, the PEI Open Data Book Club, ran from Sept 2015 to Nov 2016, but has been since folded back into PEI Devs. Our members are often involved with other tech meetups on PEI.
* Another sub-group is a proper "book club"/reading group that meets monthly.

### Achievements

* Nearly [60 meetings](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/MeetUps.csv) over 6 years.
* Several [special events](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/SpecialEvents.csv) such as [hackathons](https://www.flickr.com/photos/100794919@N05/albums/), code retreats (esp. [GDCR](https://www.coderetreat.org/)), and socials.
* Regarding Open Data, Open Gov:
    * Our group (as the Open Data Book Club) presented on Open Data at the [Directors' Forum](http://peidevs.github.io/OpenDataBookClub/presentations/2015_DEC_17_Directors_Forum/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#0) for the Government of Prince Edward Island.
    * The PEI Open Data Book Club joined groups from Ottawa and Toronto for a lighting talk at the 2016 Canadian Open Data Summit. Video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DiBSloGRl0&feature=youtu.be&t=3h15m37s) at 3h15m37s.
    * Invited Elections PEI to present for us in April 2018. The dialogue contributed toward their recent [Open Data Licence](http://www.gov.pe.ca/photos/original/EPEI_ODLICENCE.pdf). 
    * A catalog of [data visualizations](https://github.com/peidevs/OpenDataBookClub/blob/master/doc/LocalResources.md) intended to illustrate examples of Open Data by local organizations, such as Elections PEI and the provincial government.
    * Carol Mayne is a senior director with the Governent of Prince Edward Island. She leads the Open Data team, and presented for us (on the [Open Government License](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/finance/open-government-licence-prince-edward-island)) in June 2016. She'll be presenting in Sept 2018 on the new Open Data [portal](https://data.princeedwardisland.ca/). 
    * We have had [hackathons](https://www.flickr.com/photos/100794919@N05/albums/) dedicated to Open Data, particular [Open Data Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Open_Data_Day) in 2016 and 2017.

### Keys to Community Building, Longevity

The following are some keys to our longevity and community.

* Regular meetings. We have a tremendous commitment to having meetings, even if they are "open forums" (which is code for "we don't have any speakers and are freaking out"). This entails several logistic items, which are mundane but vital:
    * Sponsors. Though our planners donate both time and some $, we rely on sponsors for the venue. Sponsors are also vital for special events like hackathons.  
    * Planning committee (aka "the Elders"). In 2015, we established a planning framework. e.g. every few months, we assign a "cat-herder" as a lead planner for meetings/events. We rely heavily on a dedicated Slack channel for planning.
    * We provide a platform for others. Our speakers include people from the provincial government, Elections PEI, law firms, etc.
* Diversity. Our members have diverse backgrounds and education. e.g. Web developers, game developers, electrical engineers, Open Data advocates, AR/VR enthusiasts etc. Our presentations benefit from this.
* Welcoming. Though we have a [mandate](http://peidevs.github.io/about/) and [code of conduct](http://peidevs.github.io/code/), we are friendly and informal.  
    * We encourage junior developers (even high-school students!) to attend and present talks.
    * For years, we have had door-prizes at meetings.
    * Of course, we welcome everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, religion etc. But we also try to ensure no pressure with respect to alcohol at our social events.
    * We practice these ideas on our popular Slack channels as well.
* Outreach
    * We are active in the community, and usually mention PEI Developers at various events (listed below).
    * Many of our members act as mentors for other organizations, such as the [PEI chapter](https://twitter.com/learningcodeyyg) of Canada Learning Code.
    * Some members advocate for Open Data by speaking for other organizations, such as the local chapter of [CIPS](http://www.cips.ca/). 
    * We have had good relations with the media, including coverage of [hackathons](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/data-computer-apps-open-government-1.3478962).
    * We've done unusual projects such as [PEI Landmarks](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/landmarks-open-data-map-1.3332428) intended to illustrate Open Data and specifically engage non-technical Islanders. A bonus: the media loves these projects.
    * Our members often attend (and sometimes speak at) tech conferences and they are invited to report back on their experiences.

### Challenges

* We'd like to see more engagement from students in local university/college. We generally have good interactions, but we want to see more students.
* In a similar vein, there are large silos of software developers in various organizations (e.g. government). We're always looking to engage with them.
* Burn-out. Though a "cat-herder" is encouraged to delegate tasks to other "Elders", there is always a risk for burn-out, especially for major events like hackathons. But having a large planning committee helps.

### Thanks

Thanks for your interest! We hope this helps.
